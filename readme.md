# BD Remux Film Encoder

A high-performance Python-based tool optimized for Apple Silicon Macs, designed to encode and remux Blu-ray discs into more compact and playable formats while maintaining exceptional quality.

## üöÄ Features

- **Apple Silicon Optimization**: Leverages Apple Silicon's hardware acceleration for maximum performance
- **Smart Encoding**: Intelligent bitrate calculation based on target file size
- **Multi-Stream Support**: Handles multiple audio tracks and subtitle streams
- **Dolby Vision Support**: Preserves Dolby Vision metadata when available
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Utilizes VideoToolbox for optimal encoding performance
- **Quality Preservation**: Maintains high quality while achieving significant file size reduction
- **Batch Processing**: Support for processing multiple files sequentially
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time encoding progress and ETA display
- **Flexible Output**: Customizable output formats and encoding settings

## üìã Requirements

### System Requirements

- macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) or later
- Apple Silicon processor (M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max, M1 Ultra, M2, or newer)
- Minimum 8GB RAM (16GB recommended for 4K content)
- Sufficient storage space (at least 3x the size of the source file)

### Software Dependencies

- Python 3.8 or later
- FFmpeg 5.0+ with VideoToolbox support
- FFprobe
- pip (Python package installer)

## üõ† Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZuidVolt/BD-remux-film-encoder.git
   cd BD-remux-film-encoder
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install FFmpeg with VideoToolbox Support**

   ```bash
   brew install ffmpeg
   ```

## üíª Usage

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following options:

```ini
# Required Settings
INPUT_FILE=/path/to/input
OUTPUT_FILE=/path/to/output
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

### Advanced Usage

you can change the config in the main.py file and see all the available setting in the config class in utils.py

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Encoding Presets

| Preset | Quality | Speed | File Size |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|
| fast | Low | Fastest | Largest |
| medium | Good | Balanced | Balanced |
| slow | Better | Slower | Smaller |

## üîç Advanced Features

### Hardware Acceleration

The encoder automatically detects and utilizes Apple Silicon's hardware acceleration capabilities through VideoToolbox. This provides significant performance improvements:

- Up to 5x faster encoding for 1080p content
- Up to 3x faster encoding for 4K content
- Reduced power consumption
- Lower CPU utilization

### Quality Control

- Smart bitrate calculation based on content complexity
- Dynamic frame analysis for optimal quality
- Automatic HDR metadata preservation
- Dolby Vision profile detection and handling

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Encoding Speed is Slow**
   - Ensure VideoToolbox is properly configured
   - Check system resource usage
   - Consider using a faster preset

2. **High Memory Usage**
   - Reduce the number of concurrent tasks
   - Increase swap file size

3. **Output File Larger Than Expected**
   - Verify target size settings
   - Check audio stream selection
   - Consider using a different preset
